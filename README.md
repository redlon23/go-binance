# Go Binance
This repo contains the necessary api calls  to start making bots that interfaces
Binance trading platform. Currently, this library only supports binance futures market, but
I am also working on coin market futures api. Adding a second interface to the library will
likely to result in breaking changes. Expect this library to stabilize after 2nd implementation
which is currently happening. 

Happy Trading!
